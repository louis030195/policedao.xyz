**policedao.xyz** is based on two ideas:

- laws written by AI: the law is fundamentally a set of rules that **maximize humans' cooperation** (e.g. allowing humans to maximize their fundamental need: wealth, health, relationships)
- a decentralised police

### laws written by AI

as history shown us laws are generated along evolution of technology

when uber came along, new laws needed to be made

same when chatgpt came out or facebook

the idea of writting the law with AI is simple: you have a set of different models scanning the internet and writing laws. again, these laws would **maximize humans' cooperation**

### a decentralised police

a decentralised community of humans & AIs optimising civilization according to these laws, e.g. making sure these rules are followed and applied

<!--

something that has been on my mind for years, the state is becoming thinner and thinner with civilization progress

we're more decentralised 

logic and rules are written in code 

do you see hwere we're going?

what are the fundamental problems of a civilization without a state?
